        "\n",
        "**Answer**\n",
        "A process pool is a programming pattern that automatically manages a pool of worker processes. It’s a mechanism for executing multiple tasks concurrently, leveraging multiple CPU cores to improve system utilization and reduce overall execution time. In Python, the multiprocessing module provides a Pool class that implements this concept.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Pool creation:** You create a Pool object, specifying the number of worker processes (defaulting to the number of available CPU cores). This initializes the pool, allocating resources for the desired number of processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task submission:** You submit tasks (functions with arguments) to the pool using methods like apply(), apply_async(), or map(). These methods enqueue the tasks for execution by the worker processes.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Worker process management:** The pool manages the lifecycle of the worker processes, including:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Creating new processes as needed to handle incoming tasks.\n",
        "*   Terminating processes when they complete their tasks or are idle.\n",
        "*   Reusing existing processes to minimize overhead.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Task scheduling:** The pool schedules tasks for execution by the worker processes, ensuring that:\n",
        "\n",
        "*  Tasks are executed concurrently, taking advantage of multiple CPU cores.\n",
        "*   Tasks are distributed evenly across available processes to minimize idle time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Result collection:** You can retrieve results from completed tasks using methods like get() or join(). The pool ensures that results are returned in the correct order and handles any exceptions that may occur during task execution.\n",
        "Resource cleanup: When you’re done using the pool, you can close and join it, releasing resources and ensuring that all tasks have completed.\n",
        "The process pool provides several benefits, including:\n",

        "Multiprocessing refers to the ability of a system to support more than one processor at the same time. Applications in a multiprocessing system are broken to smaller routines that run independently. The operating system allocates these threads to the processors improving performance of the system.\n",

        "**Why Multiprocessing:-**\n",
        "Consider a computer system with a single processor. If it is assigned several processes at the same time, it will have to interrupt each task and switch briefly to another, to keep all of the processes going. This situation is just like a chef working in a kitchen alone. He has to do several tasks like baking, stirring, kneading dough, etc. So the gist is that: The more tasks you must do at once, the more difficult it gets to keep track of them all, and keeping the timing right becomes more of a challenge. This is where the concept of multiprocessing arises.\n",
